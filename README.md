# AbyssImpact


Welcome to the AbyssImpact dev team!

This project is being written in Angular.

Syntax highlighting for the extensions: .java, .js, .html, .css, .ts, .json are recommended

IDE Setup
---------

Feel free to use your own IDE but this tutorial is for VS Code:

- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli)

- In an (elevated) powershell run the command: ``` Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted ```

- Install the extension 'GitHub Pull Requests and Issues' for VS Code

- In a terminal (powershell or VS Code) run the command ``` git config --global user.name "John Doe" ``` and the
command ``` git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com ``` replacing 'John Doe' with your name/email.

- Connect VS Code to your GitHub account

- Clone a repository from GitHub (using the url ```https://github.com/StanleyRoberts/AbyssImpact```). Now you have checked out main, from this create and publish a new branch for you to work in. And finally run ```ng add @angular/material``` in the VS Code terminal.

- Start coding! :)

 **ONLY** commit and push changes to your own branch.
 Create a pull request if you want those changes merged to main.
